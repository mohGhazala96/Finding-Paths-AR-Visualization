# Finding-Paths-AR-Visualization

This project uses Unity AR foundation.
The aim is to visualize various finding paths algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra,A-Star) in real time at various speeds (Time/step).

### Features 

```
1. Control the size of the grid (4x4,8x8, 16x16, 32x32)
2. Choose the finding path algorithm (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra,A-Star)
3. Randomise obstacles
4. Tap on a specific tile to generate an obstalce
5. Control the speed at which the algorithm is visualized
6. Control the scale of the gride (Size x1, Size x2, Size x3, Size x4)

```
